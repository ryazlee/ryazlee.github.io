        Sorry, but I plan to monetize this service and do not want to share this code with the public.  
        <br>
        <br>
        This code successfully automates the log in for the UC Berkeley Student Login page in order to view meal points to give the students a more visual representation on the meal point status.  If you want to see this code, please contact me at <a href = "mailto:ryanjlee@berkeley.edu">ryanjlee@berkeley.edu</a>.

        Thank you for your time.
