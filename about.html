Hello!  My name is Ryan Lee and I am a first year student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. During my free time, I enjoy doing random things just to make people smile. Here are a few are some of those things: </br></br>

Everyday I post a “#guessthatsongday” on my snapchat story, where any of my friends could see and try to guess a snippet of a song with certain words replaced by emojis. Since I had manually done this everyday, I decided to write a java program that would do it for me. Here is an example of what I am talking about: <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ryazlee/guessthatsongday/blob/master/song.html">#guessthatsongday!</a></br></br>

I occasionally post videos to youtube where I do random things to brighten up peoples' day. Here is a link to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZ415vgd09RYPUcaN1E--A">channel</a>.
</br></br>If you want to see some of the things I have coded its on my personal <a href="https://ryazlee.github.io">website</a>.
