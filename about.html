Hello!  My name is Ryan Lee and I am a first year intended Computer Science major. During my free time, I enjoy doing random things just to make people smile. Here are a few things I have done for fun: </br></br>
Everyday I post a “#guessthatsongday” on my snapchat story, where any of my friends could see and try to guess a snippet of a song with certain words replaced by emojis. Since I had manually done this everyday, I decided to write a java program that would do it for me. Here is an example of what I am talking about: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ryazlee/guessthatsongday/blob/master/song.html
</br></br>I occasionally post videos to youtube where I do random things to make people smile. Here is a link to my channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZ415vgd09RYPUcaN1E--A?view_as=subscriber
</br></br>If you want to see some of the things I have coded its on my personal website (https://ryazlee.github.io).
